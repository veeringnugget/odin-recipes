# odin-recipes

Welcome to my first project! Simple one - but everyone starts somewhere.

I'm currently partway through https://theodinproject.com and i've already found it insanely good (who knew learning about how the internet and servers worked could be so interesting!).

This is my initial attempt at building a simple recipe page that hopefully in the future can be tweaked and improved as time goes on. For starters, I'm keen to get the initial HTML basics down.
